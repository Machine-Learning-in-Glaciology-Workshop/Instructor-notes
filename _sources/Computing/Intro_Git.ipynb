Integrating your changes to the original repository can be done by doing a pull request, which we will explore later in this tutorial.

    "### commit\n",
    "\n",
    "In the commit above, we  used the `-m` flag to specify a message at the command line.  If we don't do that, git will open the editor we specified in our configuration above and require that we enter a message.

When you `git push`, you sincronize the local version of your repository with the _remote_ version of the repository, that is, the version storaged online in GitHub.

You can see the repote repositories sincronozed with you reposotory using `git remote -v` or instead by looking at all the branches of you reposotory, enither local or remote, with `git branch -all`."

In order to incorporate changes from one repository to another we use GitHub's pull request. Doing this is a very simple procedure and you can find a step-by-step of how to do this in (this post)[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request]. \n",

This is normally done through a code review, which is normally done by a separate user who can provide a critical eye on the changes being pushed. During the code review, comments can be added, and individual (lines or file) changes can be accepted or discarded in order to help decision making. The author of the pull request then can perform further changes in new commits, update the pull request and iterate through this process until everyone is happy.\n",
