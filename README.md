# Instructor notes

Notes from the theoretical courses taught during the Machine Learning in Glaciology workshop, at the Finse research station (Norway).

## Lecture 1: Physics-based machine learning for glacier modelling

*Authors:* Jordi Bolibar, Facundo Sapienza

[The presentation](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-in-Glaciology-Workshop/Mass_Balance_ML_modelling/raw/main/Presentation_PhysicsBased_ML_Glaciology.pptx)
introduces students to the general concepts of a machine learning pipeline. How to properly design a dataset, how to correctly
train models and how validate, test and understand the capabilities and limitation of the model(s). 

The following contents are covered:

- **Modelling the glacier system**
  - Glacier evolution models
  - Local vs Global glacier modelling
  
- **Physics-based machine learning**
  - Machine learning pipelines
  - Regression for physical processes
    - Respecting physics
      - Feature selection
      - Data driven machine learning
      - Physical losses or Physics-Informed Neural Networks
      - Neural/Universal Differential Equations
    - Trustworthy models
      - Testing and validation
      - Physical interpretation
    - Being mindful about model limitations
- **Project description**

## Lecture 2: Deep Learning for remote sensing and glacier mapping

*Authors:* Benjamin Robson, Konstantin Maslov and Thomas Schellenberger

The three presentations will cover 
1. Remote Sensing in Glaciology Remote Sensing in Glaciology â€“ the traditional basics
2. Random Forest and Deep learning image classification for Glacier Mapping
3. Cryospheric Mapping with Remote Sensing - an overview of the problems, data and methods (with a focus on OBIA and debris-covered glaciers
